        <h3 class="text-secondary">Background</h3>
        <p>I am an accountant, turned software engineer. I started off my career in Tax Compliance, assisting large hedge funds and PE clients with their tax concerns. I soon realized a lot of the work being done was quite repetitive and could be done in a more efficient manner. I then had the chance to work in the Quantitative solutions group, where I learned the ETL tool, Alteryx. After using Alteryx, I decided to teach myself how to program. I then started taking courses at community colleges, MOOCs,youtube and the school of hard knocks aka building my own projects.</p>
